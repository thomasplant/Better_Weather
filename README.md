# Better Weather
View the website at https://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~thomasplant/

This Website was designed and created as a project to learn how to use JavaScript and a small design process of a website.

The original idea was to use Weather.gc.ca API to display the weather but I kept having problems and ultimataly desided to change to Weather bits API
