# Better Weather
View the website at https://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~thomasplant/

This website was designed and created as a project to learn how to use JavaScript and a small website design process.

The original idea was to use Weather.gc.ca API to display the weather, but I kept having problems and ultimately decided to change to Weather bits API
