  <h1> About </h1>
  <p id="about">This website was designed and created by Thomas for CSC 130. The goal for this website is to combine
    many
    different sources for weather and put them into one place. The goal is to do this in a beautiful, user friendly way
    that
    makes weather easy and fun for everyone to look at.</p>

  <h3 id="about">Questions </h3>
  <div id="about">
    <ol>
      <li>The idea is that I will create my own weather website that will simplify how we check weather </li>
      <li>Most of the website will be in 2d, in the end I would love to have some 3d interactive maps to help you see
        the different weather systems coming in. </li>
      <li>I want to use weather api's to gather multiple weather prodictions and find the trends in the systems and
        filter out the exceptions.</li>
      <li>The idea that weather stations and predictions are not co-operative makes little sense as it seems that most
        have a low accuracy in Victoria, my hope is that by combinding all the different weather api's I can find the
        forcast will be more accurate.</li>
      <li> XR could be used to visualize 3d maps in the futre, where you could visually see the weather radar map as
        it
        comes towards your area.</li>
      <li> Why XR isn't the best idea </li>
      <ol class="sublist" type="a">
        <li>XR will make the website harder to use </li>
        <li>XR will add a significant amount more time to check the weatheri</li>
        <li>Since XR would take more time and make it harder to check the weather it might draw people to a website
          that
          is easier to use</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Why the design is better or worse in 3d</li>
      <ol class="sublist" type="a">
        <li>This could add many more new and interesting ways to view content</li>
        <li>3D could help add some animations that would make the websites appearance be amazing</li>
        <li>3D would take away from the simplicity taking away from the goal</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The only real possibility is in maps, most other features would not prove very beneficial</li>
      <li> Auditing your ideas</li>
      <ol id="sublist" type="a">
        <li>Implementing this would be very easy in 2D most of the data could be shown in a table, though it may not
          look amazing</li>
        <li>3D would add many benifitis to how you view the content, it would mostly make the projct more attractive
          and
          make it easier on the eyes, most of the 3D effects would be for looks</li>
        <li>I think almost everything could be done in 2D but I think things like navigation and maps would be much
          more
          interesting in 3D and give my project a leg up from other websites</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Adding design principles</li>
      <ol id="sublist" type="a">
        <li>This website will be simple to use, with hopefully tons of info</li>
        <li>Very simple prompts that are not hidden behind multiple menues, I want to avoid how the <a
            href="https://weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/marine_menu_e.html"> Goverment Website </a> handles this problem.
        </li>
        <li>Hopefully the 3d elements will make the website a bit more desirable to use</li>
        <li>This will be a collection of data so hopefully this will make it more valuable than other websites</li>
        <li>For the start will be Victoria only so should be easy to find the info I plan to keep the site very local,
          so hopefully it will keep it nice and simple to find your location.</li>
        <li>Maybe I will have a simplify button or something to make the webpage less resource heavy and easier for
          web
          readers so that my website can reach everyone.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Empathy Map</li>
      <ol id="sublist" type="a">
        <li>Says: nothing, just gets answers (my hope is the website is very easy to use)</li>
        <li>Thinks: hopefully they donâ€™t need to think about their request too much, just quickly gets info(the amount
          of clicks should be minimal, the hardest thing should be getting to the website)</li>
        <li>Does: Only needs to make max of 10 clicks and a little bit of scrolling(make the website about reciving
          info
          and not finding your own information)</li>
        <li>Feels: like this only took a few seconds to get info.(feels easy)</li>
      </ol>
